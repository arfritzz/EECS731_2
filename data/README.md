The data for this project came from : 

https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/shakespeare-plays

Data set holds information from all of Shakespeare's plays. The columns are 

1. Data-Line to keep track of the rows
2. Play lines are from 
3. Actual line being spoken
4. Act-Scene-Line which any given line is from 
5. Player saying the line 
6. Line being spoken 

### Which data to use

The original data is found in `1028_2124_bundle_archive/Shakespeare_data.csv` After imported that data, I trimmed the PlayerLine category and exported it to the file `PlayerLine_trimmed` where I built the models to classify Player.
