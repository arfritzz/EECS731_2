## Project Description

In this project I used data collected on all the Shakespeare plays. I used classification models to determine the Player based on given and derived features. 

The data can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/shakespeare-plays

## Results 

The data is given with features for Player, Play, PlayerLineNumber, ActSceneLine, and PlayerLine. I first trimmed the data for the PlayerLine to reason if the line had a negative or positive connotation. I then used the features Play, Act, Scene, Line, and polarity of the PlayerLine to classify the Player. The models I chose were Decision Trees and Random Forest. These models resulted in 70% accuracy in determining the Player.
